      <h2 class="text-slate-50">Cancellation and Refund Policy</h2>
      <p>Our Service generally includes a free trial option. Following the free trial, the user may choose to continue using our Service under a free tier plan. By upgrading to a paid plan, the user acknowledges that their usage will exceed the limitations of the free tier plan and will require the additional features and support provided by the paid plans. All payments made for such upgrades are non-refundable.</p>
      <p>If you cancel a paid plan, the cancellation will become effective at the end of the then-current billing cycle. You will not receive any refund for the remaining portion of the paid plan subscription. Your account will be downgraded to a free account at the end of the then-current billing cycle, and you will no longer have access to the features available only to paid plan users.</p>
      <p>You acknowledge and agree that Upmaru may, at its sole discretion, disable access to features available only to paid plan users upon cancellation of the paid plan subscription. Upmaru will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from or in connection with the cancellation of a paid plan subscription or the downgrade of the account to a free account.</p>
      <h2 class="text-slate-50">Errors and Bugs</h2>

Upmaru will make reasonable efforts to investigate and resolve any reported errors or bugs in a timely manner, but makes no guarantees as to the outcome or timeline for such investigations and resolutions.</p>

You acknowledge and agree that the use of Upmaru's Products and Services is at your own risk, and that you are solely responsible for any consequences that may arise from such use.</p>
      <h2 class="text-slate-50">Intellectual Property Rights</h2>
      <p>The content of the Platforms, including but not limited to text, graphics, logos, images, audio clips, digital downloads, data compilations, and software, is the property of Upmaru and is protected by United States and international copyright laws. You may not copy, reproduce, distribute, publish, display, perform, modify, create derivative works, transmit, or in any way exploit any part of the content of the Platforms without our prior written consent.</p>
      <p>You acknowledge and accept that any use of the content of the Platforms not expressly authorized by these Terms is a violation of Upmaru's intellectual property rights and may subject you to legal liability. You also acknowledge and accept that Upmaru may modify or update the content of the Platforms at any time, without notice or liability.</p>
      <h2 class="text-slate-50">Indemnification</h2>
      <p>You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Upmaru, its affiliates, officers, directors, employees, agents, and licensors from and against any and all claims, liabilities, damages, losses, costs, expenses, or fees (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising from or in connection with your use of the Platforms, your breach of these Terms, or your violation of any applicable law, regulation, or third-party right.</p>
      <p>You acknowledge and agree that Upmaru reserves the right, at its own expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by you, in which event you will cooperate with Upmaru in asserting any available defenses.</p>
      <h2 class="text-slate-50">Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
      <p>The Platforms are provided "as is" and "as available," without any warranties of any kind, express or implied. To the maximum extent permitted by law, Upmaru disclaims all warranties, whether express or implied, including but not limited to warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, and quiet enjoyment. Upmaru does not warrant that the Platforms will meet your requirements or be uninterrupted, timely, secure, or error-free, or that any defects in the Platforms will be corrected.</p>
      <h2 class="text-slate-50">Limitation of Liability</h2>
      <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, Upmaru and its affiliates, officers, directors, employees, agents, and licensors will not be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or exemplary damages, including but not limited to damages for loss of profits, goodwill, use, data, or other intangible losses, resulting from or in connection with your use of the Platforms or the inability to use the Platforms, whether based on warranty, contract, tort, or any other legal theory, even if Upmaru has been advised of the possibility of such damages.</p>
      <p>You acknowledge and agree that Upmaru's total liability for any claims, losses, or damages arising from or in connection with these Terms or your use of the Platforms, whether in contract, tort, or otherwise, will be limited to the amount paid by you to Upmaru for the use of the Platforms during the twelve (12) months preceding the event giving rise to such claims, losses, or damages.</p>
      <h2 class="text-slate-50">Dispute Resolution</h2>
      <p>These Terms will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to its conflict of law provisions. Any dispute arising from or relating to these Terms or the Platforms will be resolved exclusively by arbitration in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association, and the award rendered by the arbitrator(s) will be final and binding. The arbitration will be conducted in English and will be held in Delaware, United States.</p>
      <h2 class="text-slate-50">Miscellaneous</h2>
      <p>These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and Upmaru and supersede all prior or contemporaneous communications and proposals, whether oral or written, between you and Upmaru. If any provision of these Terms is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that these Terms will otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable. Upmaru may assign or delegate these Terms, in whole or in part, at any time with or without notice to you. You may not assign or delegate any rights or obligations under these Terms without Upmaru's prior written consent, and any unauthorized assignment or delegation by you is void. The failure of Upmaru to enforce any right or provision in these Terms will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision unless acknowledged and agreed to by Upmaru in writing. The section titles in these Terms are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect.</p>
