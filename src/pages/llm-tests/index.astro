    question: "Is the code for these tests open-sourced?",
    answer:
      "For now we do not have plans on open-sourcing the test suite, the reason being that we want to avoid having the model creators optimize models for the tests. Since that defeats the premise of an 'intelligent model' that can 'generalize' over problems. The models should be able to solve these problems based on their training without specializing for these tests.",
  },
  {
    question: "What makes this benchmark different from other benchmarks?",
    answer:
      "These tests are based on real use cases. They test how capable a model is in the context of an agentic system. These systems have to reason about the user's query, be able to solve problems and generate an output that is accurate. This is the use-case required by many enterprise level agentic applications. Models that pass these tests are highly likely to succeed in enterprise applications.",

      <div class="prose prose-invert mt-3 max-w-none text-base-content/75">
        <p>
          Building agentic systems is hard. Getting a system to process user
          queries correctly while respecting system-level constraints requires
          coordination, testing, and iteration. Choosing the right model can
          make or break your workflow, and the model should not be the limiting
          factor in your system.
        </p>
        <p>
          These tests are designed to help identify which models are worth
          exploring for agentic systems, and which ones should be avoided and
          why. Avoiding the hype cycle of each new model release and knowing
          which models actually work will put you ahead when building reliable
          agentic systems.
        </p>
        <p>
          Model makers also have a strong incentive to optimize for benchmark
          scores while failing in real use cases. See this paper for one
          example:
          <a
            href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.20879"
            class="link link-primary"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer">https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.20879</a
          >.
        </p>
        <p>
          The goal is to reduce uncertainty so you do not have to guess whether
          failure comes from your orchestration design or from model capability
          limits.
        </p>
        <p>
          If we are going to move forward as an industry, we must accept the
          truth of outcomes so we can make real improvements and work toward
          agentic systems that are correct, useful, and safe for users.
